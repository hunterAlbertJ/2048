## Game Rules
+ Controls - all numbered tiles slide in the direction a player moves them using the four arrow keys.
+ Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid.
+ Every turn, a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the board with a value of 2.
+ If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will combine totals into a single tile.
+ The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move.
+ Higher-scoring tiles change colors.
+ If a move causes three consecutive tiles of the same value to slide together, only the two farthest Tiles will combine.
+ If all four spaces in a row or column are filled with the same value, a move parallel to that row/column will combine the first two and last two.
+ The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board.
+ When the player has no legal moves (there are no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same value), the game is over.
